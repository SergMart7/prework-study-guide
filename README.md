# World of languages

## Description

We currently live in a world where there are not only various languages,but, there are also many dialects and various meaning for many words. The goal of this project is to develop a program that will help translate those and break it down to regional dialects for a more accurate translation.

### My motivation

There are various reasons for the devolempent of this project, some of them are:
- Being able to effectivly communicate with others with out simply relying on literal translations.
- Learn about new ways to call things
- Be able to kickstart a develpment project

### Problems that it will solve

- Language barriers
- Communication issues
- Clear comprehension between various dialects (such as american english to british english)

## Instalation

Once development is complete, links to download from both Apple's App store and Google's play store will be listed down below.
We will also launch programs on the following platforms
- MacOs
- Window
- Linux

## Usage

With our project, the main use for it will be to effectivly communicate in many languages even if the user has no knowledge of aforementioned language.
It can be used to speak to anyone going down to their regional dialect and (to an extent) slangs, as it will facilate communication between the user and his desired target.
